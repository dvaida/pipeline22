Some considerations for the app:

I'd go with FastAPI for perf reasons but mostly for handling everything error / REST stuff automatically.
For proof of concepts I'm more comfortable with Flask but FastAPI seems to have evolved to similar simplicity

Chose pip + requirements.txt for simplicity, but I will obviously go with any build stack already available
